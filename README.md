# Letter_Freq_Languages
Python Code to generate letter frequency histograms for languages.
The code ltr_freq_lang_github.py contains code to generate histograms
of letter frequency in Western European Languages, i.e., Englist, French , German , Spanish and Italian.
The alphabet used in these languages, including diacritical marks in alphabet letters, is contained in the variable
'wstrneu_alpha'.
Examples are given for English , Spanish, French and German;  please refer to the .png file.

In order to run the code, one supplies the number of languages for which letter histograms are required. Text (.txt files)  of articles in the required languages are stored in a directory. The storage locations of the files, that is the filename paths, should be entered at the prompt that appears while running the code. In addition there is a prompt to supply heading titles for each of the letter histograms.

Code to determine the frequency of characters in some South Asian languages will be subsequently added.
